I am a fourth year graduate student in the Department of Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. My primary research interests are in American political institutions, particularly American courts, and applying formal theoretical models in empirical research. I am also a member of WashUâ€™s Formal Theory Workshop and Political Data Science Lab.

Before coming to WashU, I earned a J.D. from Baylor Law School. Studying the law and working for judges fueled an interest in studying courts and other political institutions rather than practicing law. My current projects focus on improving theoretical models of judicial policymaking, reconceptualizing agenda setting in federal courts (with Thomas G. Hansford and James F. Spriggs, II), measuring ideology (with Jacob Montgomery), and understanding demand-side effects in the relationship between political competition and judicial independence (with Joshua Boston and David Carlson).
