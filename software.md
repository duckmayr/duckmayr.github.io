In the course of my research projects, I have found it useful to develop a few R packages, which can all be found on my [GitHub](http://github.com/duckmayr).
A few are in a somewhat mature stage of development:

## [RcppDist](https://github.com/duckmayr/RcppDist)

RcppDist provides header-only C++ library with functions for additional statistical distributions that can be called from C++ when writing code using Rcpp or RcppArmadillo. You can find the development version on [GitHub](https://github.com/duckmayr/RcppDist); version 0.1.1 is [on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppDist).

## [bggum](https://github.com/duckmayr/bggum)

bggums provdes R tools for a Bayesian approach to estimating Generalized Graded Unfolding Model (GGUM) (Roberts, Donoghue, and Laughlin 2000) parameters. You can find the development version on [GitHub](https://github.com/duckmayr/bggum).
